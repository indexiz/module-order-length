# module-order-length
This module is helpful if you want to shorter the length of Order ID. For example, default length of order ID is 9 digits (like #000000001). So if you want to decrease this length then in admin configuration, you need to choose a number between (0-9) for order length i.e. if you enter 6 then Order ID will be 6 digits like #000001
