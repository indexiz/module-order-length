# Indexiz_OrderLength module

This module is helpful if you want to shorter the length of Order ID.

### For Example:
Default length of order ID is 9 digits (like #000000001). So if you want to decrease this length then in admin 
configuration, you need to choose a number between (0-9) for order length i.e. if you enter 6 then Order ID will be 6 
digits like #000001 and if you enter 4 then Order ID will be 4 digits like #0001
